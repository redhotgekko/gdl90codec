# GDL90 Codec

This is a partial implementation of the [FAA GDL90 Specification](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/air_traffic/technology/adsb/archival/GDL90_Public_ICD_RevA.PDF).

The intent is for this project to eventually be able to encode and decode a reasonably full set of the possible messages.
